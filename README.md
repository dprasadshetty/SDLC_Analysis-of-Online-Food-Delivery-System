## Introduction
Online food delivery platforms integrate features such as **menu browsing, real-time order tracking, secure payments, and live driver tracking**. The project evaluates **Waterfall, Incremental, and Spiral** SDLC models to determine their effectiveness in building such a system.

## System Overview
A real-time food delivery system consists of:
1. **User App** – Order food, track deliveries, and make payments.
2. **Restaurant App** – Accept and manage food orders.
3. **Driver App** – Navigate to pickup and delivery locations.
4. **Backend System** – Handles order processing, authentication, and payments.
5. **Real-Time Tracking Engine** – Enables GPS-based tracking and dynamic ETA calculations.

### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
- **Functional**: Secure login, order placement, driver allocation, real-time tracking.
- **Non-Functional**: Scalability, security, fault tolerance, low latency.

## SDLC Model Comparison
| Criteria        | Waterfall | Incremental | Spiral  |
|----------------|----------|------------|---------|
| **Nature**      | Linear   | Phased     | Iterative |
| **Flexibility** | Low      | Moderate   | High |
| **Risk Management** | Poor  | Moderate   | Excellent |
| **User Feedback** | Limited | More      | Continuous |

**Conclusion**: The **Spiral Model** is the best choice due to its flexibility, iterative improvements, and continuous risk management.

## Requirements Engineering Process
1. **Elicitation** – Gather user needs through interviews and surveys.
2. **Analysis & Validation** – Ensure feasibility and consistency.
3. **Specification** – Document requirements with acceptance criteria.
4. **Management** – Track requirement changes efficiently.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Dynamic Demand Fluctuations** → AI-driven demand prediction.
- **Payment Failures** → Multiple payment gateways with fallback options.
- **GPS Inaccuracies** → Hybrid tracking using GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

## Emerging Technologies
- **AI & ML** – Personalized recommendations, fraud detection, and route optimization.
- **IoT** – Smart kitchen automation and temperature-controlled deliveries.
- **Blockchain** – Secure transactions and transparent order tracking.
- **Drones & Robots** – Autonomous food deliveries.

## Case Studies
- **DoorDash**: AI-driven delivery route optimization.
- **Zomato**: Data analytics for customer recommendations.
- **Uber Eats**: Real-time tracking and diverse payment integrations.
- **Swiggy**: AI-powered operations and grocery delivery services.

## Conclusion
The **Spiral Model** is the most suitable SDLC approach for a real-time online food delivery system, ensuring scalability, risk management, and adaptability. Future trends include **hyper-personalization, sustainability, and AR/VR for enhanced user experience**.
